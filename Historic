1. Churchill
Historic-style portrait of Winston Churchill in a pinstripe suit and bowler hat, holding a 
Thompson submachine gun ("Tommy Gun") with both hands. He stands confidently, a cigar in 
his mouth, expression calm but resolute. The lighting emphasizes the texture of his suit 
and the metallic details of the 1940s-era weapon. Background features a moody, desaturated brick wall, 
evoking a wartime atmosphere with cinematic contrast and subtle historical drama.

2. Tesla
Epic cinematic portrait of Nikola Tesla standing in a dark Victorian laboratory illuminated 
by coils of blue lightning. He wears a high-collared black coat with a white cravat, eyes 
glowing faintly with electricity as arcs of Tesla coil energy spiral around him. One hand is 
outstretched, conducting pure lightning between his fingers. The background features glowing 
machinery, copper coils, and futuristic schematics floating holographically. Moody lighting, 
hyper-detailed texture, dramatic sci-fi fusion of steampunk and futurism. Caption across the 
image: “The present is theirs, the future is mine.”
