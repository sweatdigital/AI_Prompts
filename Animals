1. Dog
Ultra-detailed close-up, wide-angle underwater upshot of a dog lunging toward a ball with mouth agape, captured with 
high-speed flash and ultra-fast shutter. The water is crystal-clear, revealing the dog’s intensely focused eyes and 
intricately textured wet fur. Shot in the energetic and immersive style of Seth Casteel.

2. Dog
Sharp, high-resolution underwater action shot of a dog mid-pounce, chasing a floating ball from below. Taken with a 
wide-angle lens and strobe lighting for vivid detail — water bubbles frozen in motion, with extreme texture in the 
fur and dramatic eye clarity. Inspired by Seth Casteel's dynamic underwater pet photography.

3. Dog
Photorealistic wide-angle underwater close-up of a dog diving toward a toy ball, teeth bared in playful intensity. 
Flash lighting and fast shutter speed freeze droplets and fur texture in stunning detail. Emphasis on glistening eyes 
and turbulent water distortion. Visual tone echoes Seth Casteel's signature underwater style.

4. Dog
High-definition underwater up-angle capture of a dog submerged mid-leap, fur rippling and eyes sharply in focus. 
Wide-angle lens exaggerates movement, while strobe flash and rapid shutter highlight the splash, bubbles, and realism. 
Styled like a cinematic Seth Casteel pet action scene.

5. Dog
Extreme detail underwater dog portrait, wide-angle close-up shot with vibrant lighting. The dog is mid-chomp at a ball, 
captured with flash and a lightning-fast shutter — each strand of fur and each water droplet in crystal-sharp focus. 
Bold, dynamic framing in the spirit of Seth Casteel's underwater animal photography.
